# Gotta Go Fast
Mythic+ (CM) And Timewalking Timer!

# To Do List
- Bottom Orientation
```
 Currently GottaGoFast only Orients from the Top -> Bottom. By Setting The Frames To Anchor @ The Bottom, Adapting Y Offsets By 300px When Switching Orientation (Ensure Sliders Support This), And
 Upon Bottom Orientation Splitting Objective String By Newline And Re-Creating It By Traversing The Table In Reverse And Adding NewLines This Can Be Achieved.
```
- Sync Timer Upon Losing Data
```
 Blizzard's Default Time Has Been Reportedly Off By A Maximum Of 20 Seconds. This Bug Should Be Reported. To Alievete The Issue GottaGoFast Should Sync Timers With Other Group Members Upon
 Relog/Rezone/Reload. To Ensure Death Is Calculated Properly Death Should Also Sync.
```
- TrueTimer
```
 TrueTimer Is Generally Disabled To Disable MS Precision. If Someone Has TrueTimer Enabled They Should Have An Option To Enable/Disable MS Precision.
```
- History Frame
```
 This Will Take A Lot Of Development. The History Data Being Recorded Should Be Displayable In A Custom Frame. It Should Be Filtered By Instance / Level / Affixes And Display
 Objective Times, Player Information, Deaths, TimeStamps And Obviously Level / Affixes.
```
